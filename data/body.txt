!!Dresser Wayne AB | Customer Support://

!!!Duration: June - November - 2013.//
The assignment had two major parts.
First, managing the customer support queries for Scandinavian customers.
Secondly, enter orders from the online sales system into the production database by hand.
To ease a time consuming step of the input process, I crafted a small program
and shared it with the team. Seeing my colleagues use my software to avoid frustration is what made me change
my master. //
