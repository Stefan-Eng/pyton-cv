!This should be a heading.//

This is a block of text
where the linebreaks should be ignored.

This should also be included in the same text as above.


So this should work for a really long text that should be
split on multiple lines as several lines it's kind of hard to just
print a lot of text without having something to write about but
it's kind of fun to have something that works most of the time.


a o o o o o o o o b o o o o o o c
a o o o o o o o o b o o o o o o c
a o o o o o o o o b o o o o o o c
a o o o o o o o o b o o o o o o c
a o o o o o o o o b o o o o o o c
a o o o o o o o o b o o o o o o c


This should be its own block if double empty separates. //

This should be its own block if line break symbol works.

/line # should be in its own block, inline comment not visible.

This should be separated to its own block because of the line dependent command.
